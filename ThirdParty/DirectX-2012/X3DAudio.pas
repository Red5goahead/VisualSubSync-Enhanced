 | DUTY: Cross-platform stand-alone 3D audio math library                   |
 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^
  NOTES:
    1.  USE THE DEBUG X3DAUDIO DLL TO ENABLE PARAMETER VALIDATION VIA ASSERTS!
        Here's how:
        Copy X3DAudioD1_X.dll to where your application exists.
        The dll can be found in the DXSDK under Utilities\Bin\x86\ (or x64).
        Rename X3DAudioD1_X.dll to X3DAudio1_X.dll to use the debug version.

        Only parameters required by DSP settings being calculated as
        stipulated by the calculation control flags are validated.

    2.  Definition of terms:
            LFE: Low Frequency Effect -- always omnidirectional.
            LPF: Low Pass Filter, divided into two classifications:
                 Direct -- Applied to the direct signal path,
                           used for obstruction/occlusion effect.
                 Reverb -- Applied to the reverb signal path,
                           used for occlusion effect only.

    3.  Volume level is expressed as a linear amplitude scaler:
        1.0f represents no attenuation applied to the original signal,
        0.5f denotes an attenuation of 6dB, and 0.0f results in silence.
        Amplification (volume > 1.0f) is also allowed, and is not clamped.

    4.  X3DAudio uses a left-handed Cartesian coordinate system with values
        on the x-axis increasing from left to right, on the y-axis from
        bottom to top, and on the z-axis from near to far.
        Azimuths are measured clockwise from a given reference direction.

        Distance measurement is with respect to user-defined world units.
        Applications may provide coordinates using any system of measure
        as all non-normalized calculations are scale invariant, with such
        operations natively occurring in the user-defined world unit space.
        Metric constants are supplied only as a convenience.
        Distance is calculated using the Euclidean norm formula.

    5.  Only real values are permissible with functions using 32-bit
        float parameters -- NAN and infinite values are not accepted.
        All computation occurs in 32-bit precision mode.                    *)
